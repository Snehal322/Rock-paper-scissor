Play Again: Choose to play another round or exit the game.


**Features**

Interactive Gameplay: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user interaction.
Random Computer Moves: The computer selects its move randomly to ensure fair play.


**Requirements**

C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler such as GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio is required to compile and run the program.
Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.


**Installation & Setup**

1] Clone the Repository:
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors.git
2] Navigate to the Project Directory:
3] Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
4] Run the compiled executable:
  ./rock_paper_scissors


**Code Structure**

rock_paper_scissors.cpp: The main source file containing the game logic, including functions to display options, handle user input, generate computer moves, determine the winner, and track scores.


**Usage**

Start the game by running the compiled program.
Enter your choice as instructed: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will then generate its choice.
